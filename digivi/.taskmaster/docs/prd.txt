1. Feature: Smart Dropdowns
   Description: Enhance the user experience in the meter reading form by converting standard dropdowns for 'farm identifier' and 'village name' into smart, searchable dropdowns. Users should be able to type into the dropdown to filter the available options dynamically.

   Implementation Notes: This feature must be implemented using frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) only, without requiring any backend changes. Consider using a lightweight JavaScript library or custom JavaScript for the search functionality.
